Methods: Focus groups and in-depth interviews, together with brief individual questionnaires, were undertaken with participants in four EWF groups: two urban and two rural, and with two well-established and two recently established groups. Results: The study found that EWF was meeting the social eating needs of its participants, doing so through nurturing a sense of community. Conclusion: The flexible model used by EWF was key to its success in achieving its aims. This allowed individual groups to evolve in ways which fitted the needs and aspirations of participants. While participants enjoyed their meals, the social environment and meal settings were determining factors for ongoing participation in EWF. © 2016 ACOTA.",I come for the friendship': Why social eating matters,yes,no,,,

Among these concerns, the reluctance of older adults to use digital media may cause them social isolation, leading to negative effects in their physical and mental health. Objective: This paper aims to formalize a model to mediate asymmetries in cross-generational communication and support the eInclusion of older adults. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews to the members of 20 cross-generational families. Following the grounded theory approach, we identified emerging themes regarding asymmetries in family communication practices when older adults are involved. We then derived and formalized computer-based mediation strategies using a model-driven engineering approach. Results: We identified three main sources of asymmetries: (1) implicit family agreements in terms of social interaction, (2) capability and preferences for using particular media, and (3) unbalanced socio-affective coupling between the involved parties. The proposed model addresses these asymmetries and provides strategies to coordinate the communication effort of family members with their elders. Conclusions: By using the proposed model, designers of software that supports family communities can conceive effective mechanisms to coordinate and mediate social communication among cross-generational family members through digital means. This allows the elderly to show a better reaction to digital media, thus facilitating their acceptance and appropriation of information technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Mediating asymmetries in family communication: Supporting the eInclusion of older adults,no,yes,,,

This review examines how non-clinical neurodevelopmental models pertinent to schizophrenia have been evaluated for their ability to reproduce behavioural deficits related to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The more frequently used are the prenatal application of the mitotoxic agent methylazoxymethanol, prenatal immune challenge and the neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion model. In general they have been extensively evaluated in models considered relevant to positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In contrast, very few studies have examined tests related to negative symptoms and, when they have, it has almost exclusively been a social interaction model. Other aspects related to negative symptoms such as anhedonia, affective flattening and avolition have almost never been studied. Further studies examining other components of negative symptomatology are needed to more clearly associate these deficits with a schizophrenia-like profile as social withdrawal is a hallmark of many disorders. Although there are no truly effective treatments for negative symptoms, better characterisation with a broader range of drugs used in schizophrenia will be necessary to better evaluate the utility of these models. In summary, developmental models of schizophrenia have been extensively studied as models of positive symptoms but, given the unmet need in the clinic, the same effort now needs to be made with regard to negative symptoms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.",Evaluating negative-symptom-like behavioural changes in developmental models of schizophrenia,,,,,

Results. Although age correlated consistently with increased erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual activity, a substantial number of older men continued active sexual behaviors supported by positive attitudes toward sexual function. It was found that both health status and perceived partner's responsiveness are prominent moderators of the age effect. Conclusion. In the absence of social isolation and health issues, many older men show persistently active sexual lifestyles as evidenced in their interest and participation in sexual activities.

Method: The data were derived from a quota sampling of 372 older adults aged 60 and above, who were interviewed at four districts in Hong Kong in 2011. Multiple group analysis was employed to examine the proposed model. Results: For the low family capital group, community social capital was found to be a significant predictor of life satisfaction, even when the well-known covariates were controlled. However, the association between community social capital and life satisfaction was statistically non-significant among the high family capital group. Discussion: The findings highlighted the interplay between community social capital and intergenerational family capital, which supported community social capital replacement theory in understanding the mechanism linking social capital to life satisfaction in older age in a Chinese context.

The UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1985), Geriatric Depression Scale (Shiekh & Yesavage, 1986), Katz ADL scale (Katz, Down, & Cash, 1970), MOS Social Support Scale (Sherbourne & Stewart, 1991), and a visual analog scale for Quality of Life (Spitzer et al., 1981) scale were used.

Community processes are key determinants of older adults' ability to age in place, but existing scales measuring these constructs may not provide accurate, unbiased measurements among older adults because they were designed with the concerns of child-rearing respondents in mind. This study examines the properties of a new theory-based measure of collective efficacy (CE) that accounts for the perspectives of older residents. Methods. Data come from the population-based Chicago Neighborhood Organization, Aging and Health study (N = 1,151), which surveyed adults aged 65 to 95. Using descriptive statistics, correlations, and factor analysis, we explored the acceptability, reliability, and validity of the new measure. Results. Principal component analysis indicated that the new scale measures a single latent factor. It had good internal consistency reliability, was highly correlated with the original scale, and was similarly associated with neighborhood exchange and disorder, self-rated health, mobility, and loneliness. The new scale also showed less age-differentiated nonresponse compared to the original scale. Discussion. The older adult CE scale has reliability and validity equivalent to that of the existing measure but benefits from a more developed theoretical grounding and reduced likelihood of age-related differential nonresponse. © 2012 Adena M.

However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,,,,,

Mental health burdens pose a grave threat to quality of life and economic productivity worldwide. Women must balance the economic, emotional and health needs of the household with their own emotional and health needs. Aims. The purpose of this study is to explore the depression level of a group of older women in the community in Macau, and to identify factors associated with depression. Design. A descriptive survey. Research method. The survey was conducted during the period July and August 2004 in six parishes in Macau; 1042 older people aged 60-98 completed a structured questionnaire. Outcome measures. Four main outcome variables were employed in the study: predisposing characteristics, physical, psychosocial and health needs/behaviours outcomes. Results. Among the women, 11·9% (n = 124) had been identified as depressed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify a model to predict older women who will have depression. The results showed that variables like having hypertension (p = 0·010), a poor social network (p < 0·001), low self-perceived scores on health status (p < 0·001) and ability to meet living costs (p < 0·001), and a low level of ability to do housework (p < 0·001) were significant risk factors for depression. Conclusion. Providing a suitable living environment and improving health conditions for older people may improve depressive symptoms, and maintaining their cognitive function and improving their functional abilities may be crucial for preventing suffering from depressive symptoms. Apart from the findings, these conclusions resonate with recent Macau guidance on managing depression in older women. This stresses the importance of prevention, early detection and stepped care, with more intensive treatment for greater severity of illness and a multifaceted approach to management. Relevance to clinical practice. It is important to regularly screen for depressive symptoms among older women in the community. Focusing on older women with increasing physical disability and social isolation should help in both the prevention and recognition of onset of depression. Light therapy and antidepressants were suggested and providing a suitable living environment and improving health conditions for older people may improve depressive symptoms; maintaining their cognitive function and improving their functional abilities may be crucial for preventing suffering from depressive symptoms. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Investigating factors associated with depression of older women in Macau,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to explore the experience of young people diagnosed with depression. Twenty-six young people were recruited from a youth mental health service. A qualitative interpretative design was used, incorporating semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews. Results provided four overlapping themes, reflecting the young people's difficulties in coming to terms with, and responding in self-protective, harmful and at times life-threatening ways to their depression: (1) struggling to make sense of their situation; (2) spiralling down; (3) withdrawing; and (4) contemplating self-harm or suicide. Study conclusions are that young people faced considerable difficulties coming to terms with, and responding to, depression. Improving young people's understanding of depression and its treatment, reducing community stigma and providing accessible and youth-focused services remain important targets for intervention.

A qualitative study using phenomenological approach was employed with four men and nine women living in their own houses.

Sociodemographic variables and measures on wellbeing (Personal Wellbeing Index, PWI), health status (EQ5D), functional ability (Barthel Index), depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression ScaleDepression subscale), loneliness and comorbidity were used. Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine differences between groups and multiple regression analyses to identify factors associated to health and well-being were performed. Significant differences in health status variables, but not in wellbeing were detected between groups. Controlling for age, differences in health status (EQVAS) were found to be not significant in both groups. In the noninstitutionalized group, people aged 78 years or more reported a significantly lower wellbeing (PWI) than younger counterparts. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that depression, functional dependence, loneliness and sex were associated with health status; while depression, health status, loneliness and the interaction of ageinstitutionalization were related to wellbeing. The results suggest that age influences communitydwelling older adults wellbeing to a greater extent than it does to institutionalized older people.

Rats were either isolated or socially housed during weeks 4 and 5 of age, and after the isolation period housed in pairs with a rat of identical housing condition until the time of testing at 12 weeks of age. Juvenile isolation caused marked effects on the frequency, duration, and latency of various social behavioral elements, whereas the non-social activities such as ambulation, rearing, and self-grooming were hardly affected. Juvenile isolation reduced social exploration, anogenital sniffing, and approach/following and increased the latency to the first occurrence of these social behavioral elements. In contrast, the sequential analysis revealed that the structure of social behavior was barely affected by juvenile isolation. Some transitions were less pronounced in juvenile isolated rats compared to non-isolated rats, but no significant differences were observed in transitions between social elements. Thus, juvenile isolation bisected the time spent on adult social interactions, whereas it did not disrupt the sequential structure of social behavior. The present data suggest that juvenile isolation reduced the motivation for adult social behavior, but when social contact is initiated, a relatively normal social behavioral pattern is displayed.

However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

Because patterns of objective social integration have evolved differently in different birth cohorts (familial integration in earlier birth cohorts more fragile, more solid in later birth cohorts), we expected different trends in the extent of loneliness in different birth cohorts. Design and methods: The three waves of the German Ageing Survey (DEAS) constitute the database for the analysis: 1996 (n = 3,979), 2002 (n = 2,766) and 2008 (n = 4,392). Loneliness was measured with the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. The German Ageing Survey (DEAS) is a nationwide representative survey of the German population aged 40-85 years. Results: Only a minority of people report being very lonely in the second part of life. Between 1996 and 2008, there is a positive trend in the extent of loneliness in the second half of life, i. e., the prevalence of loneliness decreased during this period of time. From 1996 to 2008, the youngest respondents (40-54 years of age) and the middle aged respondents (55-69 years) demonstrated a decline from 1996 to 2002 followed by an increase in loneliness between 2002 and 2008. The oldest respondents (70-85 years of age) experienced a steady decline in loneliness. Gender differences (men are somewhat lonelier than women) remain stable between 1996 and 2008. Discussion and conclusion: While people who are currently old are socially well integrated and, hence, experience loneliness only to a small degree, there is a higher risk for persons who are currently in middle adulthood because their social networks have become increasingly more fragile.

The present research addresses the question of whether the type of social engagement (group-based vs. individual) has differential effects on these cognitive health outcomes. Drawing on population data (N = 3413) from three waves (i.e., Waves 3, 4 and 5) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we investigated the independent contribution of group and individual engagement in predicting cognitive functioning four years later. Hierarchical linear regression was used entering age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and physical health as covariates. The final model, controlling for initial cognitive function and social engagement (both group and individual) showed that only group engagement made a significant, sustained, and unique contribution to subsequent cognitive function. Furthermore, the effects of group engagement were stronger with increasing age. These findings extend previous work on the social determinants of health by pinpointing the types of relationships that are particularly beneficial in protecting cognitive health. The fact that group engagement optimized health outcomes, and that this was especially the case with increasing age, has important implications for directing community resources to keep older adults mentally active and independent for longer. © 2014.","""The we's have it"": Evidence for the distinctive benefits of group engagement in enhancing cognitive health in aging",,,,,

There are many stressors involved in the care of a person affected by AD: loneliness, depression, coping with unpredictable patient behavior, lack of knowledge regarding care of AD patients, etc. Monitoring the safety of AD patients and taking care of basic needs are sometimes challenging for caregivers.

The current study focuses on mobile remote presence (MRP) systems as used by a population who could potentially benefit from more social connectivity and communication with remote people -older adults. Communication technologies are important for ensuring safety, independence, and social support for older adults, thereby potentially improving their quality of life and maintaining their independence [24]. However, before such technologies would be accepted and used by older adults, it is critical to understand their perceptions of the benefits, concerns, and adoption criteria for MRP systems. As such, we conducted a needs assessment with twelve volunteer participants (ages 63-88), who were given first-hand experience with both meeting a visitor via the MRP system and driving the MRP system to visit that person. The older adult participants identified benefits such as being able to see and be seen via the MRP system, reducing travel costs and hassles, and reducing social isolation. Among the concerns identified were etiquette of using the MRP, personal privacy, and overuse of the system. Some new use-cases were identified that have not yet been explored in prior work, for example, going to museums, attending live performances, and visiting friends who are hospitalized. The older adults in the current study preferred to operate the MRP themselves, rather than to be visited by others operating the MRP system. More findings are discussed in terms of their implications for design.","Mobile remote presence systems for older adults: Acceptance, benefits, and concerns",,,,,

It is crucial to recognize early onset symptoms to initiate specific preventive care. Therefore, early detection of frailty with appropriate screening instruments is needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the underlying dimensionality of the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), a widely used self-report screening instrument for identifying frail older adults. In addition, criterion validity of GFI subscales was examined and composition of GFI scores was evaluated. Methods. A cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the structural validity, internal consistency and criterion validity of the GFI questionnaire in older adults aged 65 years and older. All subjects completed the GFI questionnaire (n = 1508). To assess criterion validity, a smaller sample of 119 older adults completed additional questionnaires: De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, RAND-36 physical functioning, and perceived general health item of the EuroQol-5D. Exploratory factor analysis and Mokken scale analysis were used to evaluate the structural validity of the GFI. A Venn diagram was constructed to show the composition of GFI subscale scores for frail subjects. Results: The factor structure of the GFI supported a three-dimensional structure of the scale. The subscales Daily Activities and Psychosocial Functioning showed good internal consistency, scalability, and criterion validity (Daily Activities: Cronbach's α = 0.81, H§ssub§s§esub§ =.84, r = -.62; Psychosocial Functioning: Cronbach's α = 0.80, H§ssub§s§esub§ =.35, r = -.48). The subscale Health Problems showed less strong internal consistency but acceptable scalability and criterion validity (Cronbach's α =.57, H§ssub§s§esub§ =.35, r = -.48). The present data suggest that 90% of the frail older adults experience problems in the Psychosocial Functioning domain. Conclusions: The present findings support a three-dimensional factor structure of the GFI, suggesting that a multidimensional assessment of frailty with the GFI is possible. These GFI subscale scores produce a richer assessment of frailty than with a single overall sum GFI score, and likely their use will contribute to more directed and customized care for older adults. © 2013 Bielderman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Multidimensional structure of the Groningen Frailty Indicator in community-dwelling older people,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - This paper is designed to provide an overview of deafblindness in NI. Supported by research and case studies, it explains the current situation, highlights the issues of this disability, the unique response required and how Deafblind UK's Connections NI project is meeting these needs. Findings - Older deafblind people are a highly vulnerable group yet there was a severe lack of services in the region catering for their specific needs. Based on work elsewhere in the UK and initial feedback, Deafblind UK's Connections NI project has been designed to support older deafblind people in the region to give them control over their life choices and retain independence as far as possible. Research limitations/implications - The project was only launched in April 2013 so although results have been achieved by Deafblind UK elsewhere in the country, it could take some time for similar results to be seen in NI, particularly when considering the nature of the work. Practical implications - Deafblind UK will work alongside agencies and in the community to raise awareness of deafblindness, helping to create clearer classification of the disability and associated issues, and deliver more targeted services that reach a higher proportion of older deafblind people in the region. Originality/value - This paper highlights the lack of services for older deafblind people in NI and how Deafblind UK is uniquely meeting these needs. © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Recently there has been much public concern over the relationship between Internet use and negative affect. This study explored the concept of IA and examined the relationship between addictive symptoms and depression. Sampling and Methods: An online questionnaire was used to measure participants' Internet use, the functions for which they used the Internet, and their depressive tendencies. Three scales were included: the IA Test, the Internet Function Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). 1,319 respondents completed the questionnaires, with 18 (1.2%) identified as falling in the IA category. Results: Correlational analyses were conducted across the whole data sample. In factorial analyses, the 18 IA respondents were compared to a matched group of non-addicted (NA) respondents in terms of their scores on the Function Test and the BDI. Across the whole data sample, there was a close relationship between IA tendencies and depression, such that IA respondents were more depressed; there were also significant differences between the sexes, with men showing more addictive tendencies than women. In addition, young people were significantly more likely to show addictive symptoms than were older people. There was a significant difference between the IA and the NA group in their levels of depressive symptoms, with the NA group firmly in the non-depressed range, and the IA group in the moderately-to-severely depressed range (F1, 34 = 22.35; p &lt; 0.001). In terms of the function for which they used the Internet, the IA group engaged significantly more than the NA group in sexually gratifying websites, gaming websites and online community/chat websites. Conclusions: The concept of IA is emerging as a construct that must be taken seriously. Moreover, it is linked to depression, such that those who regard themselves as dependent on the Internet report high levels of depressive symptoms. Those who show symptoms of IA are likely to engage proportionately more than the normal population in sites that serve as a replacement for real-life socialising. Further work needs to be done on validating this relationship. Future research is needed to corroborate the existing evidence and address the nature of the relationship between IA and depression: there is comorbidity between these conditions that needs greater investigation. © 2010 S.

This review examines how non-clinical neurodevelopmental models pertinent to schizophrenia have been evaluated for their ability to reproduce behavioural deficits related to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The more frequently used are the prenatal application of the mitotoxic agent methylazoxymethanol, prenatal immune challenge and the neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion model. In general they have been extensively evaluated in models considered relevant to positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In contrast, very few studies have examined tests related to negative symptoms and, when they have, it has almost exclusively been a social interaction model. Other aspects related to negative symptoms such as anhedonia, affective flattening and avolition have almost never been studied. Further studies examining other components of negative symptomatology are needed to more clearly associate these deficits with a schizophrenia-like profile as social withdrawal is a hallmark of many disorders. Although there are no truly effective treatments for negative symptoms, better characterisation with a broader range of drugs used in schizophrenia will be necessary to better evaluate the utility of these models. In summary, developmental models of schizophrenia have been extensively studied as models of positive symptoms but, given the unmet need in the clinic, the same effort now needs to be made with regard to negative symptoms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.",Evaluating negative-symptom-like behavioural changes in developmental models of schizophrenia,no,no,,,

In particular, the study on the usage of social media tools by older adults has been of a core theme to investigate. In this study, the interaction with a social network site tool, Facebook photo albums, supported by an agent embedded in an assistant robot is analyzed. Therefore, we present a study that explores the relationship between the type of interaction with the social network tool, and the level of perceived usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning and satisfaction by the elderly as users. The study found that the type of interface interaction with the social media tool affect the perception of the older adults in usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning and satisfaction: the older adults perceived the Facebook photo albums tool more useful, easy to use, easy to learn and felt more satisfied during the interaction with the robotic interface supported by the agent. Based on the results of this work, we can approach toward the integration of social network sites technologies for older adults and robots, not only for interaction design considerations, but also to help the seniors to overcome technological and social isolation.

The most significant increase was found among the older adults aged 65 or above. Methods: Poisson Regression Models were used to examine impact of the SARS epidemic on older adults suicides in Hong Kong. A complete set of the suicide statistics for the period 1993-2004 from the Coroners' Court were made available for the analysis. Chi-square test was used to compare the profile of the older adult suicide cases in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. Results: It showed an excess of older adults suicides in April 2003, when compared to the month of April of the other years. A trough, instead of the usual summer peak, was observed in June, suggesting some of the older adults suicides might have been brought forward. On a year basis, the annual older adult's suicide rates in 2003 and 2004 were significantly higher than that in 2002, suggesting the suicide rate did not return to the level before the SARS epidemic. Based on the Coroners' suicide death records, overall severity of illness, level of dependency and worrying of having sickness among the older adult suicides were found to be significantly different in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. Conclusion: The SARS epidemic was associated with an increase in older adults' suicide rate in April 2003 and some suicide deaths in June 2003 might have been brought forward. Moreover, an increase in the annual older adults' suicide rate in 2003 was observed and the rate in 2004 did not return to the level of 2002. Loneliness and disconnectedness among the older adults in the community were likely to be associated with the excess older adults' suicides in 2003. Maintaining and enhancing mental well being of the public over the period of epidemic is as important as curbing the spread of the epidemic. Attention and effort should also be made to enhance the community's ability to manage fear and anxiety, especially in vulnerable groups over the period of epidemic to prevent tragic and unnecessary suicide deaths.

Intervention in a quasi-experimental study was conducted among 58 older participants at the baseline (M = 72.4 years) and 45 older participants at the follow-up research study (M = 72.9 years). Inferential statistics showed a significant difference in the reduction of loneliness between the countries, and a decreased level of loneliness of older people after completing the computer training course. Although older people experience many age-related problems which may reduce their interest in learning information and communication technology (ICT) skills, it is important that they are computer-proficient, because computer engagement can reduce the level of loneliness of older people and in this way has a positive effect on their quality of life. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
